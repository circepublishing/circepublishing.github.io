The story begins with a young merchant Antonio obtaining a loan from Shylock on behalf of his friend Bassanio. Bassanio requires the money to woo a wealthy heiress Portia. Shylock resenting Antonio agrees to lend the money on the condition of extracting a pound of his flesh in case he defaults on the payment. The unthinkable happens with Antonio losing his wealth and falling in debt to Shylock. Meanwhile, Bassanio is successful in his attempt to win the affections of Portia.</p>
        
        <p>The play climaxes in a court scene where Portia disguised as a lawyer delivers her famous “mercy” speech to win the case against Shylock.</p>
